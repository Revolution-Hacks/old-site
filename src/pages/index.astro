			<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">What is Revolution?</h2>
			<p class="text-lg">Revolution is a hackathon that will be hosted in England in Summer of 2025. It will be a 48-hour Industrial Revolution themed event over 3 days where teenagers can build projects and learn new skills.</p>
			<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Where will Revolution be?</h2>
				<p class="text-lg">We're hoping to host Revolution at the 1830 Warehouse at the Museum of Science and Industry located in Manchester. We think that would be a cool venue because the worldâ€™s first inter city railway opened here in 1830 and was used for over 140 years making it a really interesting historical site and relating to the Industrial Revolution and steampunk theme. </p>
